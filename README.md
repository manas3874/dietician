# AI based Dietician â€“ tailored nutrition planning with real time data visualisation.
The online artificial dietician is a bot with artificial intelligence about human diets. It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real dietician. Dieticians are educated with nutrient value of foods. A dietician consults a person based on his schedule, body type, height and weight. The artificial intelligence dietician too asks all this data from the user and processes it.
