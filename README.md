# AI based Dietician â€“ tailored nutrition planning with real time data visualisation.
    The online artificial dietician is a bot with artificial intelligence about human diets. It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real dietician. Dieticians are educated with nutrient value of foods. A dietician consults a person based on his schedule, body type, height and weight. The artificial intelligence dietician too asks all this data from the user and processes it.
    The aim is to develop an open-source project on which developers worldwide can contribute. This project would be a great nutrition-manager for the mankind.
